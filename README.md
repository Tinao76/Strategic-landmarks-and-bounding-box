**Model Training**

Model training for the species classification using strategic landmarks was performed based on the highly ranked track quality ranking with a clear and defined outline. The dataset was split into training, validation and testing using the ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. For training, the train.py file was used. The figure below highlights the strategic landmark points for various species:

**Species Classification**

The field species classification was performed using the test.py. The following are the sample field testing results across three quality rankings.
